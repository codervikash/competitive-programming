#Problem

#Given a linked list where in addition to the next pointer, each node has a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure.You are given the head of the first level of the list. Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level linked list. You need to flatten the list in way that all nodes at first level should come first, then nodes of second level, and so on.

#Input:
#1 - 2 - 3 - 4
#    |
#    7 - 8 - 10 - 12
#    |   |    |
#    9   16   11
#    |   |
#    14  17 - 18 - 19 - 20
#    |                   |
#    15 -23             21
#        |
#        24

#Output:
#Linked List to be flattened to
#1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 8 - 10 - 12 - 9 - 16 - 11 - 14 - 17 - 18 - 19 - 20 - 15 - 23 - 21 - 24
