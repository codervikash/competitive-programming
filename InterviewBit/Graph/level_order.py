"""
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodesâ€™ values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

Example :
Given binary tree

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its level order traversal as:

[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
Also think about a version of the question where you are asked to do a level order traversal of the tree when depth of the tree is much greater than number of nodes on a level.
