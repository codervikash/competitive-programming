# Problem Statement
#
# You are given a string of lower case letters. Your task is to figure out the index of the character on whose removal it will make the string a palindrome. There will always be a valid solution.
#
# In case the string is already a palindrome, then -1 is also a valid answer along with possible indices.
#
# Input Format
#
# The first line contains T, i.e. the number of test cases.
# T lines follow, each containing a string.
#
# Output Format
#
# Print the position (0 index) of the letter by removing which the string turns into a palindrome.
